#¬†üìê Maximum character length calculator for UI elements

**Live Demo:** [https://max-char-length-calculator.netlify.app](https://max-char-length-calculator.netlify.app)

This tool calculates the maximum allowable character length for UI elements like buttons and labels, based on real data. It is designed to help UX/UI designers optimize text lengths for readability and consistency across languages and screen sizes. The calculator is based on the formula and approach detailed in [this article](https://uxcontent.com/a-formula-for-defining-maximum-character-lengths/).

## Formula overview

The calculation formula is:
`MAX LENGTH = BUTTON WIDTH / AVERAGE CHARACTER WIDTH``

Here, the **average character width** is derived by averaging the widths of all characters in a dataset, weighted by their frequency of use.

## Getting started

To complete the calculation, users should provide:

1. **Dataset as a JSON file** ‚Äì Supply character frequency and width data in JSON format. You can refer to a [sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steroman/max-char-length-calculator/refs/heads/main/src/assets/sample-files/en-us.json) to understand the required structure.
   - Alternatively, use the default generic dataset (Note: currently supports only English as the source language).
2. **UI Element Width** ‚Äì Input the width of the target UI element in pixels, minus any padding or margin.
3. **Character Widths** ‚Äì Specify the width in pixels for each character.
4. **Additional Localizations** (optional) ‚Äì Include extra JSON files for other languages to adjust maximum character lengths according to language expansion rates.

### Dataset customization

When using custom datasets, users can apply the following filters:

- **Ignore capital letters** ‚Äì Treats uppercase and lowercase as the same character (e.g., `A` and `a`).
- **Ignore numbers** ‚Äì Excludes numeric characters (`1`, `2`, etc.).
- **Ignore symbols** ‚Äì Removes non-alphabetic symbols (e.g., `!`, `?`).
- **Ignore spaces** ‚Äì Omits spaces from the dataset.
